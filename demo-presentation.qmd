## Quarto Slides


This is a Quarto relealjs-based presentation using the tikz engine to compile LaTeX to png and place the png on a slide. 

You can do the same with other Rmd (R markdown) based slide and html outputs (bookdown, etc.). 

The source for this file is in [the repo here](https://github.com/UMWordLab/linguist-slides): 

## Tree

(@tree1)
```{tikz tikz-ex, fig.cap = "this is a caption", fig.ext = 'png', engine.opts = list(template = "tikz2png.tex")}

\begin{tikzpicture}
\Tree [.S [.NP this ] [.VP [.V is ] [.NP {a tree} ] ] ]
\label{fig:tree1}
\end{tikzpicture}

```

## Tree with Code

chunk options used:
```{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
{tikz tikz-ex2, fig.cap = "this is a caption", fig.ext = 'png', engine.opts = list(template = "tikz2png.tex"), echo = TRUE}
# tikz2png.tex template is required (in project directory) to load special LaTeX packages like tikzqtree
```


```{tikz tikz-ex2, fig.cap = "this is a caption", fig.ext = 'png', engine.opts = list(template = "tikz2png.tex"), echo = TRUE}

\begin{tikzpicture}
\Tree [.S [.NP this ] [.VP [.V is ] [.NP {another tree} ] ] ]
\label{fig:tree2}
\end{tikzpicture}

```
